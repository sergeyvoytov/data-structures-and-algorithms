# Stacks and Queues

Stacks
- used push method makes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top
- used pop method does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
- used peek method does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
- used isEmpty method does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty

- Enqueue method takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue
- Dequeue method does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue
- Peek method does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
- isEmpty method does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
